# 👋 Greet

I started thinking about how I could help people find a job they love and how I could help tech companies win the “war for talent”. As a result, I launched Greet. It is a marketplace where you get paid to refer your friends to tech jobs. It is an ongoing project and it currently consists of a landingpage and an admin dashboard. Both the landingpage and the admin dashboard is built with React and styled with Tailwind. Firebase is used as a database and to handle authentication.

There are currently 5 companies on board, 11 jobs posted and in total 220 000 SEK available in hiring rewards. For example, you get rewarded 25 000 SEK if you refer a frontend engineer (who gets hired) to Depict.

## Product overview: Landingpage

The goal of the landingpage is to let “Greeters” refer their friends and for companies to sign up.
