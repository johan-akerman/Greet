                There are around one billion cows on the planet. Together they
                produce over 4% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions just by
                farting and burping methane gas. Volta is on a mission to reduce
                these emissions to mitigate global warming. By providing farmers
                with an entirely natural seaweed-based feed supplement to
                drastically reduce the methane emissions produced by dairy cows
                and beef cattle, Volta is supporting the agriculture sector in
                taking a massive leap in going sustainable.
